  <h3><b>OOP School Library: by Ometman</b></h3>
   <h5>This app is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) school library project built in Ruby for library-related systems management needs. Students, teachers can be added and removed as Persons. Books can be addded or removed; and rental details can be recorded to manage rentals. The power of OOP in Ruby is employed to implement abstration, classes, objects, patterns, encapsulation, inheritances and polymorphism.
   
   Testing was effectively done to check best pratices, code optimization and maintainability.
   Enjoy it!
